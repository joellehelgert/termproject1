# termproject about population and its changes in Linz

Due to our degree programma we need to do a termproject. Our termproject should be a visualization of information about Linz.

## Idea

In many social and political discussions, the demographic changes are regarded. To understand the social fabric and which problems it might bring. Due to the amount of data fast conclusions are difficult because maybe some points are missing or interpreted wrongly. So the first step is to understand the relation of several aspects and what is happening. Therefore the app visualizes the data with different graphics so that the user can understand the topic interactively. Several demographic topics are covered in the application as:
 - migration (age, homeland, gender)
 - influx and departure within the districts
 - the age distribution within one district
 - family status within the districts
 
Some of the aspects can be visualized with an animation of how the situation changes over the years. Additionally, filters can be applied to get individualized results. The interaction with the map should be close to hands-free AR. This means that the user can interact with markers on the map directly. Through the interactive and simple design, the topic is easier to understand independent of the personal background.
